How-To: Work with Tagged NanoId strings
===

Ananoid can serve most uses cases via the `cref:T:pblasucci.Ananoid.NanoId`
type and its associates (`cref:T:pblasucci.Ananoid.Alphabet`, et cetera).
However, sometimes this is not desired (or at least, not _optimal_). For times
when the a struct or class is just too much, Ananoid also provides its core
functionality -- cryptographically-secure randomly-generated identifiers -- as
functions which take simple inputs and just produce strings ([as seen here][1]).
And, for F# consumers, there is one more option: tagged identifiers. This
feature attempts to strike a balance between the performance of raw strings and
safety of more robust types.

Effectively, instead of generating strings, the functions in the
`cref:T:pblasucci.Ananoid.Core.Tagged` module (ab)use F#'s [units of measure][2]
functionality to generate strings that have been "tagged" with a special
measure, `cref:T:pblasucci.Ananoid.Core.Tagged.nanoid@measure'`. This causes
them to be typed-checked separately from ordinary string. However, as they are
erased at run-time, they pose none of the overhead of full types (like
`cref:T:pblasucci.Ananoid.NanoId`). Usage can be as simple as:

<div class="lang-bar">
<details open class="lang-block">
<summary>F#</summary>

```fsharp
open pblasucci.Ananoid.Core.Tagged

let taggedDefaultId = nanoId' ()
let taggedNumericId = nanoIdOf' "0123456789" 12
```
</details>

<details open class="lang-block console">
<summary>Interative Session</summary>

```sh
> open pblasucci.Ananoid.Core.Taggd;;

> let taggeedDefaultId = nanoId' ();;
    taggedDefaultId: string<nanoid> = "SG0vBABewIRQxruwugpTD"

> let taggedNumericId = nanoIdOf' "0123456789" 12;;
    taggedNumericIdL string<nanoid> = "387443539896"
```
</details>
</div>

Ananoid further provides the `tag` function for converting simple strings into
tagged strings. For converting in the opposite direction (from a tagged string
into a simple string), simply use the built-in `string` function. The follow
example helps to demonstrate the usage of `tag` and `string`:

<div class="lang-bar">
<details open class="lang-block">
<summary>F#</summary>

```fsharp
let simpleId = nanoId ()
let taggedId = nanoid.tag simpleId

let simpleId' = string taggedId
printfn $"%s{nameof simpleId} = %s{nameof simpleId'}? %b{simpleId = simpleId'}"
```
</details>

<details open class="lang-block console">
<summary>Interative Session</summary>

```sh
> dotnet fsi ~/scratches/taggednanoid.fsx

simpleId = simpleId'? true
```
</details>
</div>
